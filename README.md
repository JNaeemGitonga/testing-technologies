# Testing Technologies

This is a repo where I am using some javascript technologies.
I have used the technologies before but it has been a while 
so I began to create something where I would be forced to apply 
that old knowledge. 

I am using Javascript, jQuery, and node and jest (for testing).

to start 
clone this repo
```
$npm install

$npm start
```

### Just started working with Java I have added some basic java classes and methods as well
